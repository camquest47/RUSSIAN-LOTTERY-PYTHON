This is a lottery app that I translated into Russian using Python Script.

Here I display precise knowledge of not only the code itself, but also the Russian language.

I receieved inspiration for the concept from Corey Schafer, with the end goal ofcourse, being to recreate the Powerball JackPot.

Hope you Enjoy!!!!!
